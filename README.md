## 🔥 Key Skills  
- **Python & Django** – Web apps and creative automation  
- **Robotics & Mechatronics** – Messing around with hardware like I know what I'm doing (I don't)  
- **Problem Solving** – Throwing ideas at the wall until something sticks  
- **Car Design** – Because cars are cool and I have taste (maybe)

## 🎯 Current Focus  
- Waiting to get into programming & robotics at **UAO (Autonomous University of West)** (Cali, Colombia) (in July)  
- Experimenting with new tools and building small robots & automations, probably making some mistakes along the way

## 🎮 Games & Simulations I Love  
- **Valve Games:** TF2, Half-Life series, Portal (**WHERE IS HL3???!!**)

- **BeamNG.drive:** Questionable ethics  
- **Flight Simulators:** I could totally land a plane, just… not in one piece
